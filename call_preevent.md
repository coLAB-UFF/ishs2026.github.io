For the first time ever, the ISHS Conference will have special registration fees for scholars coming from the Global South. However, we are aware that many institutions from those countries suffer from difficulties in funding travel costs or simply do not have programs to support the participation in conferences abroad. Considering this state of things, as well as the very interesting works presented by scholars from the Global South in previous ISHS events, the local organizing committee decided to create an online pre-event, exclusive for scholars from the Global South unable to attend the in-person gathering in Niterói.

This pre-event webinar has limited spaces. The articles submitted to this webinar will be assembled in thematically coherent panels, which will be livestreamed for members of the International Society for Humor Studies.

Panelists will have 15 minutes to present their work and 5 more minutes for discussion. Only articles and presentations in English will be allowed in this format.

The guidelines for submission are the same as the ones for the papers presented in the in-person conference. Please provide a title, a 250-word abstract and a short bio-note, and check the correspondent checkbox while registering in order to get the reduced fee for online presentation. Please note that this option does not allow the participation in the regular conference. 

To submit your individual paper for the pre-event webinar, please click on register now at the bottom of this page, and submit your abstract. It is not possible to present papers both in the webinar and in the regular conference. In case of any doubt, please write to the conference convenors at humorstudies@midia.uff.br

Please submit your proposal by March 27, 2026, using the button below.
