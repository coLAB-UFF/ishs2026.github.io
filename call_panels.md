The ISHS welcomes papers from the numerous expertises, such as social sciences, communication and media studies, anthropology, political science, history, psychology, education, linguistics and translation, folklore, computational sciences and engineering, robotics, law, among others. 

The abstracts submitted to the conference are assembled into panels, bringing together works on similar subjects. These panels can be created by the conference organizers or proposed by conference attendees answering to this call. Any individual can propose a panel, as long as they can gather a sufficient number of proposals organically organized around a theme.

Panel proponents receive and analyze paper submissions to their panels autonomously and independently. Panels may have one or two main proponents, and they are freely organized to discuss the papers. They also may include external debaters or the proponents themselves as debaters and mediators. Each panel will last 90 minutes per session, should have between three and five papers and allow at least 15 minutes for presentation and at least five minutes for discussion of each paper. Panel proponents are responsible for keeping track of the time during the presentations and for moderating the discussion. 

Each proponent is also responsible for publicizing the call for papers for their panel, and by gathering all the necessary information for the submission. Upon request, the conference organizers can help spread the word about each call for panels in the conference's website and social media. To submit your panel proposal, please click on register now at the bottom of this page, and submit your related papers. In case of any doubt, please write to the conference convenors at humorstudies@midia.uff.br

Please submit your proposal by February 27, 2026, using the button below.

### Manuscript Format

The proposal must include:

* Title and brief description (one to two short lines) about the interests covered by the panel.
  
* Title and short abstract for each of the works to be presented in the panel, with a minimum of three and a maximum of five works listed for presentation.

* List of respective authors and their mini-bios. All authors must have agreed to submit their abstracts to the panel. Authors must also register to the conference separately, but not submit their abstracts individually (considering that this task will be done by the panel proponents). 

Both the proposers and all presenters must be registered beforehand, and, if the panels are approved, everyone must have paid the registration fee for the conference. Authors and proponents of panels are also allowed to submit roundtables proposals and individual papers, if they so wish.

Members of the Special Interest Groups are specially welcomed to propose panels, organizing the discussions a few months before the conference.

### Mode of Presentation

No remote presentations will be allowed for pre-organized panels.

### Languages

Submissions in this tab must consist of papers in English. To ensure effective discussion during the panels, no bilingual panels will be allowed.

Also, the conference will not feature pre-organized panels in Portuguese, with the exception of the ones formed by the organizing committee with individual papers submitted in Portuguese (please check the tab “Call for panels” for more info about it).

### Individual Papers

If you are submitting a pre-organized panel, please note that there is no need to submit the individual papers beforehand. You only need to list them during the registration of your panel.
